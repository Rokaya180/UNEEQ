First Task At Uneeq Interns ðŸš€ 

Summary of Findings:



began with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python before transitioning to Power BI for dynamic visualizations. The primary focus was to investigate the weak areas in Retail Superstore.



Insights:

1- Higher Discounts Lead to Lower Profitability:

The Profit by Discount (Line Chart) clearly shows a decline in profit as discount levels increase.

*Beyond 20% discount, profits start turning negative.*



2- Office Supplies is the Most Discount-Sensitive Category

Office Supplies shows the highest profit when no discount is applied.

However, when higher discounts are introduced (above 20%), profitability drops significantly, making it the most discount-sensitive category.

In contrast, Technology products sustain profitability even with moderate discounting.



3-Discount Strategy & State Profitability

The most profitable states (e.g., California, New York, Washington) primarily use no discount or low discount strategies, leading to higher profit margins.

In contrast, the least profitable states (e.g., Texas, Ohio, Pennsylvania) apply the highest discounts, but instead of driving sales, these discounts lead to profit erosion.



Policy Recommendation:

- Limit Discounts to â‰¤20% for Most Categories â†’ Since discounts above 20% lead to losses.

- Reduce discounts on Office Supplies to prevent profit erosion.

- Test strategic discounting on Technology products since they sustain profits even at moderate discounts. 

- Reevaluate discounting policies in low-profit states, as higher discounts do not always translate to better revenue.
