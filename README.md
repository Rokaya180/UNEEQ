First Task At Uneeq Interns ðŸš€ 

Summary of Findings:



began with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python before transitioning to Power BI for dynamic visualizations. The primary focus was to investigate the weak areas in Retail Superstore.



Insights:

1- Higher Discounts Lead to Lower Profitability:

The Profit by Discount (Line Chart) clearly shows a decline in profit as discount levels increase.

*Beyond 20% discount, profits start turning negative.*



2- Office Supplies is the Most Discount-Sensitive Category

Office Supplies shows the highest profit when no discount is applied.

However, when higher discounts are introduced (above 20%), profitability drops significantly, making it the most discount-sensitive category.

In contrast, Technology products sustain profitability even with moderate discounting.



3-Discount Strategy & State Profitability

The most profitable states (e.g., California, New York, Washington) primarily use no discount or low discount strategies, leading to higher profit margins.

In contrast, the least profitable states (e.g., Texas, Ohio, Pennsylvania) apply the highest discounts, but instead of driving sales, these discounts lead to profit erosion.

Policy Recommendation:

- Limit Discounts to â‰¤20% for Most Categories â†’ Since discounts above 20% lead to losses.

- Reduce discounts on Office Supplies to prevent profit erosion.

- Test strategic discounting on Technology products since they sustain profits even at moderate discounts.

Second Task at Uneeq Interns ðŸš€ 

In this project, I conducted a stock market analysis.The goal was to identify market weaknesses, risk factors, and strategic investment opportunities

Analysis preformed:

âœ… Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified weak spots in global stock exchanges

âœ… Sharpe Ratio & Risk Analysis: Evaluated the best-performing markets with risk-adjusted returns

âœ… Volatility Clustering: Spotted high-risk periods across different regions

âœ… Market Crash Detection: Analyzed extreme downturns and global financial shocks

âœ… Rolling Correlation: Revealed stock indices moving together, tracking systemic risks

âœ… Economic Event Impact: Measured how global crises (COVID-19, 2008 Crash, etc.) shaped markets.

InsightsðŸ“Š:

1) Some markets (e.g., Germany, Hong Kong, and Switzerland) have higher risk-adjusted returns, meaning they perform well even after accounting for volatility.

- Strategy: Diversify into high Sharpe Ratio markets for long-term wealth preservation.

2) China and Europe had frequent high-volatility periods, exposing investors to high-risk clusters.

- Policy: Introduce dynamic risk controls (e.g., volatility circuit breakers) to reduce systemic crashes.

3) European indices (GDAXI, N100, NYA) showed high correlation, meaning a crash in one could cascade into others.

- Strategy: Expand portfolio exposure beyond correlated regions to mitigate contagion effects.

- Reevaluate discounting policies in low-profit states, as higher discounts do not always translate to better revenue.
